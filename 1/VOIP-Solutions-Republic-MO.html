<p>VoIP phone service has been around for a long time as entrepreneurs and businesses change from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to an advanced system. There is a substantial range of VoIP providers on the internet which offer SIP trunking (telephony services) for cheaper call rates than conventional telephony providers.
