<p>VoIP phone service has been around for a long time as entrepreneurs and businesses change from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to an advanced system. There is a substantial range of VoIP providers on the internet which offer SIP trunking (telephony services) for cheaper call rates than conventional telephony providers. The software and hardware is affordable, too, for VoIP phone systems. In addition, wireless "locations" in places such as cafes, airports, and parks permit you to connect to the Internet and may allow you to use VoIP service wirelessly.</p>
