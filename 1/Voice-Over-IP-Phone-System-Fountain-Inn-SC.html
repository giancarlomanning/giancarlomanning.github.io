<p>If you have actually never ever become aware of VoIP, prepare to alter the method you think about long-distance phone calls. A cloud-based phone system transfers calls through data networks instead of through traditional phone lines. Then we determined what kinds of phone systems are the very best match for various types of organisations. If you're a larger business, and you already have a Leased Line (dedicated high-speed fibre connection which cost ₤ 300-1,000 monthly), it's a close choice in between the pure VOIP and the Hybrid Phone System.</p>
<p>A major requirement for digital phones is a key service unit or KSU which is required to run your phone.

If the answer is yes, then we would recommend a cloud telephone system for your business, with a cloud phone system anybody with access to the internet can link to the phone system, there is no requirement for expensive hardware or licence cards.</p>
