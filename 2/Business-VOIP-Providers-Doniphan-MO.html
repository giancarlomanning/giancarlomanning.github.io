<p>VoIP phone service has been around for some time as services and business owners switch from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. PBX means private branch exchange, which is an expensive term for a business phone system. Business VoIP phone service has actually been advancing over the previous decade.
